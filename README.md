## Directions for Future Development 

**Concept:** 
Wanted to create an app for bands who act as their own tour managers to make it easier to plan out directions and drive times for an entire tour. 

**Future User Story:**
As a band on tour, I want to see my entire tour mapped out with hotel, restaurant, and bar options in close proximity to the venues, so that I am on time for my sound checks, interviews and performances. 

**Directions for future development:**
1. Develop a  map view for the user to see the entire tour mapped out on the map display in order of tour dates. 

2. Develop a for loop for the events response that returns all of that band or musicians tour dates. Each date in the list should be  clickable and bring the user to more details about that concert.

3. Each event response should include the city, venue, drive time and distance between shows. When the event is clicked, details about that event should expand and let the user know when they need to leave their current city in order to make their next sound check, interview or show on time. 

4. Within the same response for each city, there should be restaurant, hotel, and bar suggestions for the band.
